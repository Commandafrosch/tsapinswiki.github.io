    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p class="about">This project was made as a way to have an acurrate way of valuing TSA pins. Our ranking system, known as Cool Beans, is a vaule put on a pin based off of how many students went to nations that year from that chapter. This web page also works as a good way to verify if a pin is really a TSA pin or any affilated program pin.</p>
