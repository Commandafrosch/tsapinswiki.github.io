    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p class="about">We are a library of most of the TSA pins. We launched this project to create a precise and dependable method for evaluating the worth of TSA pins. Our innovative ranking system, known as Cool Beans, calculates a value for each pin based on the number of students who represented their chapter at the national event. Furthermore, this website serves as a comprehensive platform for verifying the authenticity of TSA pins and any associated program pins. This project is student-owned and student-led.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Our Goal</h1>
    <p class="about">Our mission is centered around tackling a prevalent issue within pin trading: the pervasive uncertainty and ambiguity surrounding the worth and legitimacy of the pins involved in transactions. We have witnessed numerous instances where individuals have been deceived into parting with valuable pins due to their limited understanding of what sets a pin apart in terms of value, or its authenticity. Our commitment involves the continuous updating of our resources to both caution and guide individuals who are navigating the complexities of the trading system. At our core, we aim to address a major issue in pin trading: the uncertainty surrounding the value and authenticity of the pins being exchanged. Countless individuals have fallen victim to scams, simply because they lacked the necessary knowledge to discern a valuable pin from a counterfeit one. Our ongoing mission is to provide accurate and current information to both alert and assist those unfamiliar with the intricacies of the trading system.</p>
